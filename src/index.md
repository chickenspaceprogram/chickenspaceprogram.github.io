# Athena Boose

I'm a Physics and Computer Engineering student primarily interested in systems
programming, compilers, and programming language design. I'm also interested in
atomic physics and physical chemistry, but there's a lot less of a focus on
those latter topics here.

If you want to contact me, check out the [contact](contact.html) page.

To see a few blog articles I've written about various topics, check out the
[blogs](/blogposts/index.html) page.

This site is statically generated with my own Unix-based toolchain. No
Javascript was used in its creation, it should work sensibly and be readable
in [Lynx][1] or any other browser that doesn't support Javascript.

Source code for this website is available [here][2] under a CC BY 4.0 license.

Not all the tooling used to create the site is under that same license; the two
dependencies are my [hmacro][3] preprocessor and [pandoc][4]. These two
dependencies will be replaced at some point, but I'm quite busy for the moment
so don't expect it soon.
